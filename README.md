# RSS Aggregator with GO

The project is an RSS Aggregator built with Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google. An RSS Aggregator is a type of software that fetches and consolidates RSS feeds from various sources into a single location. RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

This particular RSS Aggregator is designed to fetch data from various RSS feeds and aggregate it. The aggregated data is then stored in a Postgres database for later retrieval and analysis. Postgres, or PostgreSQL, is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

The requirements section lists the technologies needed to run the project. In this case, the project requires Go (specifically version 1.22) and Postgres (specifically version 16.3). These versions are likely the ones the project was developed and tested with, so using them would help ensure compatibility and smooth operation.

### requirements

- Go (Version 1.22 used in this project)
- Postgres (Version 16.3 used in this project)

## TODO

- [ ] Write tests to ensure the program works as expected
- [ ] Define a front-end interface to display the aggregated data
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization to the REST API
- [ ] Implement caching to improve performance
- [ ] Add error handling and logging to the program
- [ ] Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability
- [ ] Document the project to help other developers understand and contribute
- [ ] Optimize the program for scalability and efficiency
- [ ] Add support for additional RSS feed formats and sources
- [ ] Integrate with third-party services for additional functionality
